# Hermes Agentic Variation

An **AVO-inspired** long-horizon experiment controller for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is independent community work. It is not NVIDIA AVO, is not affiliated with NVIDIA, and does not reproduce NVIDIA's unreleased internal implementation.

## Current status: Phase 0

Phase 0 builds the deterministic control-plane foundation before any autonomous execution exists.

Implemented now:

- immutable, versioned contracts for run specifications, candidates, evaluations, supervisor advice, and terminal receipts;
- stable canonical SHA-256 identities;
- a deterministic run state machine with explicit terminal states and bounded stagnation handling;
- a SQLite run ledger with optimistic concurrency and append-only transition evidence;
- a model-free fixture evaluator that fails closed on missing correctness or score evidence;
- two read-only Hermes tools:
  - `avo_phase0_info`
  - `avo_validate_run_spec`
- an opt-in Hermes Desktop companion with an **Agentic Variation** configuration page;
- configurable planning defaults for step, time, cost, stagnation, network, toolset, and evaluator fields, stored in the Desktop plugin's isolated local storage.

Not implemented in Phase 0:

- model calls;
- subagent launches;
- command execution;
- repository mutation;
- experiment scheduling;
- network access;
- candidate promotion or deployment.

That absence is deliberate. First make the control plane boring and correct. Then attach an agent.

## Architecture

```text
Approved immutable RunSpec
  -> bounded variation step (future)
  -> deterministic evaluator
  -> append-only evidence receipt
  -> eligible candidate or recorded failure
  -> stagnation gate
  -> bounded supervisor advice (future)
  -> next step or explicit terminal receipt
```

The evaluator—not a model—owns candidate eligibility.

See [`docs/PHASE0.md`](docs/PHASE0.md) for contracts, states, invariants, and acceptance evidence.

## Development

Requirements: Python 3.11–3.13.

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -q
ruff check .
hermes plugins doctor . --ci
```

## Testing in Hermes

Do not install an unreviewed checkout into a daily-driver profile. Validate the directory first:

```bash
hermes plugins doctor /path/to/hermes-agentic-variation --ci
```

A native plugin install is opt-in and should remain disabled until its exact reviewed commit is selected for a test profile.

### Hermes Desktop

This repository is a unified Hermes package: the native Python plugin lives at the root and the Desktop companion lives at `desktop/plugin.js`. After installation, the Desktop half inventories in **Settings → Plugins** as **Agentic Variation** and remains off until enabled. Enabling it adds:

- an **Agentic Variation** sidebar entry;
- a configuration page at `/agentic-variation`;
- an **Agentic Variation: configure** command in the command palette.

The Phase 0 options are inert planning defaults. Changing them does not enable model calls, child agents, commands, networking, or experiment execution.
